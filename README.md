# Where do I keep my personal code?

I do not use GitHub for personal projects. I have this account for work and to be able to access some projects but I don't think that GitHub is the right place to host your source code.

Please see: [Sourcehut repo](https://git.sr.ht/~nightmareartist/) for my personal projects.
